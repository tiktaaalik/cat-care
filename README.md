## Blackie

He's almost 17 and has mellowed, but is still a bit mistrustful of humans. He's particular about being touched, but he is a sweet, gently little old man.

* First, let him sniff you and rub his pudgy cheeks on your hand.
* All rubs must be gentle.
* He likes gentle rubs from his nose up to the center of his head (no ears though), under his chin, and on his neck and shoulder blades.
* He can bite and scratch, but he is pretty harmless.
* Pick up at your own risk.

## Dobias (Doobie)

He's a sweetie and loves everybody. Pick him up, give him belly rubs...he loves attention. 


## Food

There is dish on right of sink that has scrubber and spoon. Use these for all cat duties.

* Dry food: fill bowls completely
* Wet food: clean out bowls and do about 3/4 of a can each. (I usually feed them 1/4 of a can each twice a day). Add some hot water to the wet food and mix up a bit please. Both should come for food, but if Doobie doesn't, pick him up and place him at the food. Blackie is on the left, Doobie on the right.
* Water scrub the bowl and replace with cold water.


## Litter Box

* In the bathroom. Use the grocery bags and place in the trash on the balconey. Add a little bit of litter.
* Blackie pees on the side of the box which is annoying. TIP: try and come from underneath and pry it off :)
* In the bathroom leading into the main room, use the swiffer to sweep the tracked litter into a pile (pile up where the swiffer is sitting). I'll vacuum when I get back.


## Barf Time!

Check for any barfs on the floor: just some damp paper towel should be fine.


## Play Time

After wet food, if you want to see Blackie act crazy, get his boucney ball out of my grey NYTimes mug on my desk. Doobie likes the string.


Thanks!
